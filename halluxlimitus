# Theory

### Stiff soled shoes → Limit joint movement → helps to calm down the inflamed synovium
### If footwear change does not help, fluroscopic-guided intra-articular steroid injection for pain relief. (Cortico-steroid injection)
### Steroid injection has a potential risk of subdermal fat atrophy and skin thinning over the 1st MPJ, which increases the risk of incisional complication
